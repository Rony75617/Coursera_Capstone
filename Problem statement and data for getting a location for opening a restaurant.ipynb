    "After selecting  food the biggest challenge for opening a restaurant is selecting a location.The location should have customers who want to eat the food.The location should also have restaurants serving the same food.If the location has more number of restaurants serving a particular food it will clearly indicate that more customers are present in that location who want that food.Hence in this assignment the goal is to find  a list of cities where more no of a particular kind of restaurants are functioning.The list will give us an clear idea of prime locations for opening a restaurant.Any businessman or investor can use this project  to give a type of restaurant for e.g. Indian Restaurant and get a list of cities where maximum number of Indian restaurants are already functioning."
